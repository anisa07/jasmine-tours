My name is Jasmine Sanjaya, I am currently living and working in Jakarta, Indonesia as both full-time tour guide and freelance Travel Experience Designer.

What can I say, I love my job! I am having trouble writing compelling texts, not to mention about myself so I will try to make this as short and informative as possible.

Growing up in Indonesia, I discovered that our country holds some of the world's most incredible hidden treasures. From the mystical temples of Borobudur to the pristine waters of Raja Ampat, every corner tells a unique story.

But what truly moves me is connecting people with these places in meaningful ways. I don't just show you destinations â€“ I help you experience the soul of Indonesia through local communities, authentic cuisine, and moments that become lifelong memories.
